<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Jianzi
is similar to tag in many ways. First of all, Jianzi and tag both can
have an unlimited number of players, so no one needs to be excluded.
Another way they are similar is that neither of them require a
special court or field, and they both can be played anywhere. Last,
Jianzi and tag can be played by kids in Kindergarten through 5th
grade. These similarities between Jianzi and tag make them both
fantastic games for groups to play at recess.</p>
