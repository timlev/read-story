Where You Live</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Who are the people
in your neighborhood where you live? DO you know the people who live
next door or across the street?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	If you live in the
city, you probably have many neighbors who live around you. Many
people in the city live in apartments. If you live in an apartment,
you may know your neighbors across the hall. There may be neighbors
above you or below you. But the people who live across the street
from your apartment may be strangers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	If you live in the
country, you may not be able to see your neighborâ€™s house. But if
you look out your bedroom window, you may be able to see their
animals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	There are many
places to go and many things to see in a neighborhood. There may be a
playground where children play. There may be a grocery store where
you can buy food or a good restaurant where you can eat.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	All neighborhoods
are different. But in some ways, they are all the same. Your
neighborhood is part of your life.</p>
