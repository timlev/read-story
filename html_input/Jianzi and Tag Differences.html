<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Jianzi
and tag have many differences. The biggest difference is that Jianzi
uses a featherball, while tag does not require a ball. Another
important difference is that Jianzi is played by kicking a ball. When
playing tag, however, players use their hands to chase each other.
Last, Jianzi and tag differ in the amount of running required. Jianzi
does not require as much running as tag does. Because of their unique
rules and equipment, Jianzi and tag are great options to add variety
to recess.</p>
