tundra biome is the coldest of all biomes. It is also quite big. The
tundra covers about one fifth of the land on earth. The word tundra
comes from a Finnish word that means treeless plain, which is a good
description of the biome. Tundra biome is located in the artic
circle, which is a circle that surrounds the north pole, but this is
not the only place we can find freezing cold temperatures and a few
animals. In Antarctica, and other cold environments, there are areas
that can be described as part of a tundra biome as well.</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

tundra is the coldest and the driest of all the biomes on Earth.
There is very little rainfall in the tundra; it rains less than ten
inches a year. Winters here are long, and summers short, sometimes
they last for only 6 - 10 weeks. In the winter the temperature can
reach -50&deg;F (-45.5&deg;C). And we think our winters are bad!
Because the tundra is so close to the north pole, summer days are 24
hours long! Summer temperatures rarely get above 50&deg;F (10&deg;C),
just enough to thaw the surface of the ground. What a place for a
summer vacation! In the summer the soil becomes very soggy from
melted snow and rain. The moisture sinks into the ground, which is
called permafrost. The permafrost lies six inches below the ground,
and is frozen for most of the year. The top layer of the permafrost
thaws, but the bottom layer of gravel and finer material stays frozen
all year which keeps moisture from rain on the surface of the ground.</span></span></span></font></font></span></font></p>

would think that plants would never live or survive in this biome,
but the answer is quite a surprise. There is low diversity in
organisms that live here, but many still flourish. Many lichens,
mosses, and small shrubs flourish in the arctic tundra. The plants
that live in the harsh permafrost soil usually adapt to the weather
by being short and grouped together to resist winds and to be
protected. The growing season in the tundra is short and lasts up to
60 days. Tundra plants get their energy from the sun through
photosynthesis like all other plants, but have adapted to low
temperatures and low light intensities. Compared to plants in other
biomes they use a minimal amount of energy.</span></span></span></font></font></span></font></p>

may think that the tundra is too chilly for animals, but guess what -
it&rsquo;s not. There are actually animals that live in this harsh
biome! You might find lemmings, caribou, and arctic hares in the
tundra. These animals seem pretty nice, but can you guess which the
largest and most dangerous animal is that lives in the tundra? THE
POLAR BEAR. Polar bears love to eat fresh, fatty meat. Fatty foods
might not be good for humans, but polar bears need the energy from
fat to survive the cold tundra. Seals, at times walrus, and sometimes
even belugas trapped in open water pockets surrounded by ice are some
of the polar bear&rsquo;s favorite meals. They will also eat berries
and eggs in the summer. Polar bears hunt by the power of scent and
can smell their food at 20 miles (32 km) away. The stomach of an
adult polar bear is so big that it can hold more than 150 pounds (68
kilos) of food! Other predators of the tundra are arctic foxes and
wolves. Some migratory birds also live in the tundra during part of
the year.</span></span></span></font></font></span></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Animals
who live in the tundra have special adaptations to survive. Some
animals in the tundra are adapted to the climate by breeding and
raising their young in the summer. Many animals hibernate, or sleep
during the worst part of winter to minimize energy loss. Because
animals of the tundra are generally migratory, this biome's
population is constantly changing. Resident animals have to change
what they are hunting and eating as the seasons change. The food
chain in the Arctic Tundra consists of predators such as owls, foxes,
wolves, and polar bears at the top of the chain. Predators hunt
herbivores, plant eating animals, such as caribou, lemmings, and
hares. Mosquitoes, flies, moths, grasshoppers, arctic bumblebees, and
other insects are at the bottom of the arctic food chain. Many birds
feed on these insects.</font></font></font></p>

tundra may seem tough, but it is a very sensitive environment. More
people have recently been moving to the tundra to work in the mines
and oil industry. New towns and roads are being built to support the
increased population. Developments have interrupted many of the
animals&rsquo; migrations and feeding patterns, as well as caused
damage to the permafrost. It takes so long for the tundra to recover
that tire tracks and footprints remain on the ground for decades
after they were made. In areas of the tundra there are also many
natural resources, such as oil. People worry that pollution from
these mines and rigs may ruin the fragile ecosystem. A caribou
migration route was interrupted by construction of the Alaskan oil
pipeline. In some places the pipeline has been raised high enough
above the ground for caribou to pass under it. Insects bombard the
tundra in the summer and birds flock there to eat them. Pesticides
used to control insects may work their way up through the food chain
and affect many of the animals that live on the tundra. We need to be
careful with the delicate tundra environment.</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There
is also much we can learn from the tundra. Permafrost has the ability
to preserve plants and animals in the cold ice for long periods of
time. Scientists can use the permafrost as a record of the past to
learn about climate. These records are a tool to compare past
climates with the current climate to see how much the earth may be
warming. As we learn more about this unique biome, it is important
that we continue to care for it.</font></font></font></p>
